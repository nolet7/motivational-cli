## GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
This project includes a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions.

### Workflow Triggers
The GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically on:
- Push events to the `main` branch
- Pull requests to the `main` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

### CI/CD Workflow Steps
1. **Checkout Repository** – Clones the latest version of the code
2. **Set up Node.js** – Configures the required Node.js environment
3. **Install Dependencies** – Installs all necessary packages
4. **Run Tests** – Executes unit tests to ensure code quality
5. **Publish to NPM** *(Optional)* – Automatically publishes the package to NPM when a new release is created

---

## Publishing the CLI Tool to NPM (Optional)
To publish this CLI tool as an NPM package, follow these steps:

### 1. Create an NPM Account
If you don't have one, register at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### 2. Login to NPM
```sh
npm login
```

### 3. Generate an Authentication Token
```sh
npm token create
```
Copy the generated token.

### 4. Add NPM Token to GitHub Secrets
- Navigate to your repository on GitHub
- Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
- Click **New Repository Secret**
- Name it `NPM_TOKEN` and paste the generated token

### 5. Create a GitHub Release
To trigger the publishing workflow:
- Go to the **Releases** section of your GitHub repository
- Click **Draft a new release**
- Tag the release version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Click **Publish release**

This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically publish the package to NPM.
